		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>One of my earliest “foodie” memories from childhood has to do with people coming back from the Amish country in southern New York State, near the Pennsylvania border, with all sorts of amazing pies, breads, and other baked goods. </p>
		<p>It was always a treat to enjoy whatever freshly made goodness they were sharing, but had I known about these beef noodles, I would have made a special request for their next road trip.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for the top</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Toss beef with salt and pepper until evenly coated.</li>
			<li>Heat vegetable oil on high heat in a Dutch oven. Brown the beef thoroughly on both sides, doing half at a time, and remove to a bowl. Turn off heat. </li>
		</ol>
